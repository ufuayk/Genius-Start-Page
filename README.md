# ‚ú® Genius Start Page

Genius Start Page is a browser start page that offers a seemingly **minimal design** with very **complex features** in the background. We hope that the project will grow even more with the **community's support** for the script. The **GPLv3 License** allows the project to be easily **edited** and **translated**. *Let's develop it together. Let's walk together.*

*Oh... yes, I may have written a little dramatic article. A little bit.*
